Most of the shortcomings I reported in lab 1 were to do with the prompts used in the
flight booking application. For example, the very open/non-directive command at the start.
In my application, my start menu lists explicitly what the options available to the user are.
Similarly, the error messages were not very informative; whilst, in my application, after
the noinput or nomatch event prompts, the system is directed to more detailed reprompts, which
include more explicit information about how the user can respond. Furthermore, in case of the
application having to return to the start of the booking service (e.g. if the destination and 
departing cities are the same, or the system did not collect the right information from the 
user), the system provides the user with information that it is starting over, and goes back to
the original prompt asking the user about their journey, rather than just going to the start 
and not prompting the user at all. Additionally, the system confirms the information with the user
in a more coherent manner than the flight booking application from lab 1. Also this application 
has a universal 'start over' command, which it informs the user about in the beginning, so that
they are aware of the possibility.
